## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-02

### Added
- **Centralized environment helpers** (`internal/environ`)
  - `IsCI()` for detecting CI environments
  - `SupportsUnicode()` for terminal capability detection
- **CA chain verification** in `verify` command
  - New `--ca` flag accepts PEM or DER format CA certificates
  - Full chain validation using `x509.VerifyOptions`
- **Network timeout for `inspect` command**
  - Default 5-second connection timeout to prevent hangs
  - New `--timeout` flag for custom timeout values
- **DRY SAN parsing** via `pkg/cert/san.go`
  - Supports DNS, IP, email, and URI SANs
  - Consistent parsing across generate, CSR, and CA commands

### Changed
- **Secure key permissions**: Generated private keys now have `0600` permissions on Unix
- **Standardized JSON output** with unified `printJSON` and `printJSONError` helpers
- **Consistent error handling**: All commands now use `RunE` with proper error returns
- **Improved code organization**: Reduced duplication across commands
- **Enhanced documentation**: Updated commands.md, usage.md, and FAQ

### Security
- Private keys are now created with restrictive permissions (0600) by default
- Proper CA certificate validation in verify command

## [0.1.10] - 2025-08-20

### Fixed
- **Critical fix for `cert update` command**
  - Fixed syscall.Exec argument issue that caused installer to drop to shell
  - Properly pass "bash" as argv[0] for syscall.Exec
  - Update command now correctly executes the installer script

## [0.1.9] - 2025-08-20

### Added
- **New `--connect` flag for inspect command**
  - Allows connecting to a different host while validating the certificate for the target hostname
  - Useful for testing certificates through proxies, tunnels, or local services
  - Supports port specification in the connect host (e.g., `--connect localhost:8080`)
  - Example: `cert inspect api.example.com --connect localhost:8080`

### Changed
- Enhanced inspect command to support split hostname/connection scenarios
- Improved examples in help text to show proxy/tunnel use cases

## [0.1.8] - 2025-08-20

### Fixed
- **Critical fix for macOS auto-update functionality**
  - Fixed SIGKILL issue when running `cert update` on macOS
  - Installer now uses atomic move operations for self-updates
  - Update command uses syscall.Exec to break process inheritance chain
  - Clears macOS extended attributes (com.apple.provenance) that prevent execution
- **Improved update reliability**
  - Downloads installer to temp file instead of piping directly
  - Better handling of running binary replacement
  - Fallback mechanisms for compatibility

### Changed
- Removed duplicate release workflow (now using only goreleaser)
- Enhanced installer script with self-update detection
- Simplified default command output (run without arguments) - examples now only shown with `cert help`

## [0.1.7] - 2025-08-20

### Fixed
- Fixed goreleaser configuration for v2 compatibility
- Added version: 2 declaration to .goreleaser.yml
